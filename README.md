# Zaun - The Power of CSS and the Beauty of Arcane

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based experience inspired by Zaun, the iconic city from *League of Legends*, and the visual style of *Arcane*. It explores the creative potential of CSS to capture Zaun's dark, industrial ambiance and the distinct personalities of its residents, particularly through pages inspired by characters like Jinx.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key HTML and CSS files:

- **lobby.html**: The main lobby page with a background video capturing the essence of Zaun.
- **aboutMe.html**: A thematic "About" page introducing Zaun's atmosphere and history.
- **contactMe.html**: A dynamic "Contact" page inspired by Jinx, featuring a glitchy, animated title and styling that matches her chaotic vibe.
- **lobby.css**: The main styling for the lobby page, creating a dark theme with a clean, flexible layout.
- **style.css**: Additional global styling, providing a glowing effect on headings and animations.

## Features
1. **Dark, Atmospheric Theme**: The CSS leverages dark backgrounds, vibrant accent colors, and a custom font (Poppins) to give the entire site an industrial, Zaun-inspired look.
2. **Character-Specific Pages**:
   - **About Me (Zaun)**: Features a subtle glow and bold color choices to represent Zaun’s energy and innovation.
   - **Contact Me (Jinx)**: Embraces a chaotic "glitch" effect for the page title and vivid purple tones, matching Jinx’s unpredictable personality.
3. **Background Video**: In the lobby, a full-screen looping video immerses users in Zaun’s atmosphere.
4. **Responsive Design**: Media queries ensure optimal viewing across devices, while CSS animations add depth.

## Highlights of the CSS Design
- **Animation and Hover Effects**: Animations such as fade-ins and text-glows create an engaging visual experience.
- **Glitch Effect**: Custom keyframes give the "Contact" page title a glitchy, jittering animation.
- **Glowing Borders and Shadows**: On buttons and containers, glow effects emphasize Zaun’s edgy aesthetics.

## Installation
To run this project, simply download the files and open `lobby.html` in a browser. Ensure that the `Arcane - Entering Zaun scene.mp4` video file is in the same directory for full functionality.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Google Fonts (for custom font styling)
- CSS Keyframe Animations

## Future Improvements
- **Interactive Elements**: Adding JavaScript for character interactions.
- **Enhanced Animations**: Using CSS transitions for more fluid user experience.
- **Customizable Themes**: Options to toggle between different *League of Legends* character styles.
